# Gluey API Docs
## Getting started
The Gluey API provides a set of endpoints for developers to perform labeling, manifesting,  tracking and fetching pudo points for parcel carriers. This documentation serves as a guide for integrate your application with the Gluey API.

The deployed docs can be found at [https://developer.gluey.ai](https://developer.gluey.ai) and we recommend that you have a look there to understand integration patterns and endpoints better.
